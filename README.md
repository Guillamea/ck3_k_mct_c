More Congenital Traits - Compatibility Version for Crusader Kings 1.5+

This is a version of <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2298410092" target="_blank">More Congenital Traits</a> that takes an alternative approach to adding higher tiers of the Congenital Traits that's focused on maximising compatability with other mods.

Other than the changes to the Giant Trait, it doesn't effect anything from the base game and instead makes the new trait levels a new set of leveled traits that are only available to those with Level 3 in the corresponding congenital traits.

A character who inherits a Level 3 congenital trait from both parents has a chance of gaining Level 1 of the corresponding bonus trait (and the chance is increased by the 2nd Blood Dynasty Perk), after the trait is gained it is subject to the usual rules for Congenital traits (for Reinforcement etc) except that inherited Bonus traits will become inactive traits instead if a child is born without the pre-requisite Level 3 trait.

Update:
2023-05-13 -
-Updated supported version for 1.9. Should be backwards compatible as far back as 1.5 but no further.
- Fixed trait icon format, so Glow works properly in Ruler Designer window and doesn't throw errors.

Added Green Icon for Giant since it's a Good trait in this.
